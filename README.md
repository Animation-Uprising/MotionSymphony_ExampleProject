# MotionSymphony Example Project (OLD)
This repository contains an example project for motion symphony with animation and blueprint samples.

**New Example Project:** A new Example Project for MS2.0+ and UE5.3+ is now available. If you are using Motion Symphony 2.0, I highly recommend using the new example project linked here instead: https://github.com/Animation-Uprising/MoSymph2.0-Example-Project

**Commercial Use:** You are free to use any assets within this project for commercial use, royalty free.

UE5+ USERS: 
- Please ensure you use the main-UE5 branch instead of main.
- If you are using Motion Symphony 2.0 please use the MoSymph-2.0 branch which only supports UE 5.2+
- This example project is updated for the latest version of UE (5.2 as of now) and may not be compatible with previous version of UE5.  
- If the example project crashes upon playing, please try re-preprocessing the motion data. If this does not resolve the issue please contact support.

Note: This project does not contain the Motion Symphony plugin itself. The plugin needs to be purchased and installed separately.
